**Fake News Prediction Project**
=============================

**Overview**
-----------

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a news article is fake or real. The goal is to combat the spread of misinformation and promote fact-based journalism.

**Description**
-------------

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze news articles and predict their authenticity. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles and uses features such as text sentiment, entity recognition, and linguistic patterns to make predictions.

**Scripts**
---------

The project consists of four scripts:

1. **data_preprocessing.py**: Preprocesses the dataset, including tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction.
2. **model_training.py**: Trains the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
3. **model_evaluation.py**: Evaluates the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
4. **news_article_analysis.pynb**: Analyzes a given news article and predicts its authenticity using the trained model.

**Technologies Used**
--------------------

* **Python**: Used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* **NLTK**: Used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and sentiment analysis.
* **Scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning tasks such as feature extraction and model training.
* **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the machine learning model.
